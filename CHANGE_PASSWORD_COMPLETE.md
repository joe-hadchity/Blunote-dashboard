# ‚úÖ Change Password Feature - Complete

## Overview
The change password functionality is **fully implemented and working** with Supabase authentication.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Frontend (Profile Page)
**File:** `src/app/(admin)/(others-pages)/profile/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Modern modal interface for password change
- ‚úÖ Three input fields: Current Password, New Password, Confirm Password
- ‚úÖ Real-time password strength validation with visual indicators:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least 1 uppercase letter (A-Z)
  - At least 1 lowercase letter (a-z)
  - At least 1 number (0-9)
  - At least 1 special character (!@#$%^&*...)
- ‚úÖ Password match validation
- ‚úÖ Loading states during password update
- ‚úÖ Toast notifications for success/error messages
- ‚úÖ Form reset after successful update

### 2. Backend API Route
**File:** `src/app/api/user/change-password/route.ts`

**Security Features:**
- ‚úÖ Authentication verification via access and refresh tokens from cookies
- ‚úÖ Proper session establishment using `setSession()` method
- ‚úÖ Current password verification (validates user knows their current password)
- ‚úÖ Password strength validation on server-side
- ‚úÖ Ensures new password is different from current password
- ‚úÖ Uses Supabase Auth's `updateUser` method for secure password updates

**How It Works:**
1. Retrieves user's access token from HTTP-only cookies
2. Verifies the token using `supabase.auth.getUser(accessToken)` (same pattern as other API routes)
3. Verifies current password by attempting sign-in with `signInWithPassword()`
4. Validates new password strength on server-side
5. Updates password using **admin client** (`supabaseAdmin.auth.admin.updateUserById()`)
6. Returns success/error response

**Why Use Admin Client:**
- The admin client has elevated privileges to update any user's password
- Bypasses the session requirement that was causing the "Auth session missing" error
- More reliable and follows the same pattern as other admin operations in the codebase
- Still secure because we verify the current password before allowing the update

**Recent Fixes (2025-01-12):**
- ‚úÖ Fixed "Auth session missing" error by using admin client instead of user session
- ‚úÖ Changed to follow the same authentication pattern as other API routes
- ‚úÖ Uses `supabase.auth.getUser(accessToken)` for authentication
- ‚úÖ Uses `supabaseAdmin.auth.admin.updateUserById()` for password update

### 3. Supabase Integration
**Files:** 
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` (Client-side)
- `src/lib/supabase-admin.ts` (Server-side admin)

**Configuration:**
- Uses `@supabase/supabase-js` client library
- Leverages Supabase's built-in authentication system
- Password updates are handled securely by Supabase Auth

## How to Use

### For End Users:
1. Navigate to Profile page (`/profile`)
2. Click "Change Password" button
3. Enter your current password
4. Enter a new password that meets the requirements
5. Confirm the new password
6. Click "Update Password"
7. You'll see a success message: "Password updated successfully! üîí"

### Password Requirements:
- At least 8 characters
- Maximum 72 characters
- At least 1 uppercase letter
- At least 1 lowercase letter
- At least 1 number
- At least 1 special character
- Must be different from current password

## Testing

To test the functionality:

1. **Valid Password Change:**
   ```
   Current: YourCurrentPass123!
   New: NewSecurePass456!
   Confirm: NewSecurePass456!
   Result: ‚úÖ Success
   ```

2. **Invalid Current Password:**
   ```
   Current: WrongPassword123!
   Result: ‚ùå "Current password is incorrect"
   ```

3. **Weak New Password:**
   ```
   New: weak
   Result: ‚ùå Validation errors shown in real-time
   ```

4. **Password Mismatch:**
   ```
   New: StrongPass123!
   Confirm: DifferentPass123!
   Result: ‚ùå "New passwords do not match"
   ```

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is required for the password update to work. This is the admin key that allows server-side operations. You can find it in your Supabase dashboard under Settings ‚Üí API ‚Üí service_role key (secret).

## Security Notes

‚úÖ **Secure Implementation:**
- Passwords are never stored in plain text
- Current password verification prevents unauthorized changes
- HTTP-only cookies protect access tokens
- Server-side validation prevents bypassing client-side checks
- Supabase handles password hashing and encryption

‚úÖ **Best Practices:**
- Validates both client-side and server-side
- Uses Supabase's built-in authentication security
- Immediate session sign-out after verification to prevent session hijacking
- Detailed error messages help users while maintaining security

## Status: ‚úÖ FULLY FUNCTIONAL

The change password feature is complete and ready to use. No additional implementation needed!
