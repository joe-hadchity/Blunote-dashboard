## 🎯 What We'll Build

### User Flow:
```
1. User fills signup form → Submits
   ↓
2. Account created (but not verified)
   ↓
3. Success message: "Check your email for verification link"
   ↓
4. User receives email with verification link
   ↓
5. User clicks link → Redirected to app
   ↓
6. Account verified → Redirected to dashboard
   ↓
7. User can now log in normally
```

## 📋 Step-by-Step Implementation

### STEP 1: Configure Supabase Email Settings

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project

2. **Enable Email Confirmation:**
   - Go to: **Authentication** → **Providers** → **Email**
   - Toggle ON: **"Confirm email"**
   - Toggle ON: **"Enable email provider"**

3. **Set Email Templates (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Go to: **Authentication** → **Email Templates** → **Confirm signup**
   - Customize the template (or use default)
   - The default template looks like:
   ```html
   <h2>Confirm your signup</h2>
   <p>Follow this link to confirm your user:</p>
   <p><a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}">Confirm your email</a></p>
   ```

4. **Configure Redirect URL:**
   - Go to: **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
   - Add your redirect URLs:
     - For Development: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
     - For Production: `https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback`
   
5. **Important Settings:**
   - **Site URL**: Set to your app URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for dev)
   - **Redirect URLs**: Add both localhost and production URLs

---

### STEP 2: Environment Variables

**Create/Update `.env.local`** in your project root:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here

# App URL (for email redirects)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**For Production**, update to:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

---

### STEP 3: Update Registration API

**File: `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`**

The registration API needs to:
- Enable email confirmation
- Set proper redirect URL
- Return appropriate message to user

Changes:
- Line 62: Change `emailRedirectTo: undefined` to actual redirect URL
- Update response to tell user to check email

---

### STEP 4: Create Email Verification Callback Page

**File: `src/app/(full-width-pages)/(auth)/callback/page.tsx`**

This page:
- Receives the verification token from email link
- Verifies the user's email
- Redirects to dashboard or shows error

---

### STEP 5: Update Signup Form

**File: `src/components/auth/SignUpForm.tsx`**

Changes:
- After successful signup, show "Check your email" message
- Don't automatically redirect to dashboard
- Display verification pending state

---

### STEP 6: Update Login to Handle Unverified Users

**File: `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`**

Add check for email verification:
- If user tries to login without verifying, show appropriate message
- Offer option to resend verification email

---

### STEP 7: Create Resend Verification Email Endpoint (Optional)

**File: `src/app/api/auth/resend-verification/route.ts`**

Allows users to request a new verification email if they didn't receive the first one.

## 🎨 User Experience Flow

### 1. Signup Success Screen:
```
✅ Account Created Successfully!

📧 We've sent a verification link to your email:
   user@example.com

Please check your inbox and click the verification link to activate your account.

Didn't receive the email?
[Resend Verification Email]
```

### 2. Verification Success Screen:
```
✅ Email Verified Successfully!

Your account is now active. Redirecting to dashboard...
```

### 3. Login Attempt Without Verification:
```
⚠️ Email Not Verified

Please check your email and click the verification link before logging in.

[Resend Verification Email]
```

---

## 🧪 Testing the Flow

### Test Signup:
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/signup`
2. Fill in the form with real email (you need to receive the email)
3. Submit the form
4. Should see: "Check your email" message
5. Check your email inbox

### Test Email Link:
1. Open the verification email
2. Click the verification link
3. Should redirect to: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback?token=...`
4. Should see: "Email verified" message
5. Should redirect to dashboard

### Test Login Before Verification:
1. Sign up with a new email
2. Don't click verification link
3. Try to log in
4. Should see: "Email not verified" error

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Token Expiration**: Supabase verification links expire after 24 hours by default
2. **One-time Use**: Verification tokens can only be used once
3. **Secure Redirect**: Always validate redirect URLs to prevent open redirects
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider limiting resend verification requests

---

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Not Receiving Emails
**Solutions:**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify Supabase email settings are enabled
- For custom SMTP, verify credentials
- Check Supabase logs in dashboard

### Issue 2: Invalid or Expired Token
**Solutions:**
- Verification link expires after 24 hours
- Use the resend verification feature
- Ensure user hasn't already verified

### Issue 3: Redirect Not Working
**Solutions:**
- Check redirect URLs in Supabase settings
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` environment variable
- Ensure callback route exists

### Issue 4: Email Already Registered
**Solutions:**
- Check if user already exists in Supabase
- Provide clear error message
- Offer "forgot password" option

## 📧 Email Provider Options

### Option 1: Supabase Built-in (Development)
- ✅ Free and easy to setup
- ✅ No configuration needed
- ⚠️ Limited emails per hour
- ⚠️ May go to spam

### Option 2: Custom SMTP Provider (Production Recommended)
Choose one:
- **SendGrid** (Free tier: 100 emails/day)
- **Mailgun** (Free tier: 5,000 emails/month)
- **AWS SES** (Pay as you go, very cheap)
- **Resend** (Modern, great DX)

**To Configure Custom SMTP:**
1. Go to: Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → Auth
2. Scroll to: **SMTP Settings**
3. Fill in your provider's credentials

2. ✅ Customize email templates in Supabase
3. ✅ Set up custom domain for emails (optional)
4. ✅ Add proper error handling and user feedback
5. ✅ Consider adding email change verification
6. ✅ Implement "resend verification" with rate limiting
