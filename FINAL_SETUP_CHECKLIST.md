## 🚀 **Quick Setup (2 Minutes)**

### **Step 1: Run the All-in-One SQL Script**

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. **Copy all content** from: `supabase/ALL-IN-ONE-SETUP.sql`
3. **Paste and click "Run"**
4. **Wait for success messages**:
   ```
   ✅ Step 1: Database reset complete
   ✅ Step 2: Meetings table created
   ✅ Step 3: Recordings table created (with nullable meeting_id)
   ✅ Step 4: View created
   ✅ Step 5: Your recordings inserted
   
   📊 Total recordings created: 2
   🎬 Video file: meeting_video_2025-10-07T12-41-12-218Z.webm
   🎵 Audio file: audnoise.wav
   ```

### **Step 2: Test the Application**

1. **Visit Recordings Page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/recordings
   ```

2. **You should see:**
   - ✅ 2 recordings in the table
   - ✅ "Test Video Recording" (VIDEO)
   - ✅ "Audio Sample - Noise Test" (AUDIO)

3. **Click on a recording:**
   - ✅ Opens `/recording/{id}` page
   - ✅ Video player shows and plays your webm file
   - ✅ OR Audio player shows and plays your wav file

## 🎯 **What Was Implemented:**

### **1. Database Structure** ✅
```
recordings table
├─ meeting_id (NULLABLE) ← Can be standalone!
├─ title, description
├─ recording_url, audio_url
├─ file_type, format, file_size
├─ status, has_video, has_transcript
└─ ...

meetings table
├─ title, description
├─ start_time, end_time
└─ ...

meetings_with_recordings view
└─ Joins both (handles standalone recordings)
```

### **2. Frontend Routes** ✅
- `/recordings` → Lists all recordings (table with search/filter/sort)
- `/recording/{id}` → Recording detail page with video/audio player
- Sidebar: "Recordings" with video icon

### **3. API Endpoints** ✅
- `GET /api/recordings` → Lists all recordings with pagination
- `GET /api/recordings/{id}` → Single recording detail
- Both support standalone recordings (meeting_id = NULL)

### **4. Features Working** ✅
- ✅ Search recordings by title/description
- ✅ Filter by platform, type, has_transcript
- ✅ Sort by date, title, duration
- ✅ Pagination (5 per page)
- ✅ Click recording → Opens detail page
- ✅ Video/audio player with your actual files
- ✅ Download links for files

## 🔍 **Verification Queries:**

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:

```sql
-- Check recordings were created
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM recordings 
WHERE user_id = 'e8403df0-339a-4879-95bb-169bca9564d8';
-- Should return: 2

-- View details
SELECT 
  id,
  title,
  file_type,
  meeting_id IS NULL as is_standalone,
  status,
  recording_url IS NOT NULL as has_video_url,
  audio_url IS NOT NULL as has_audio_url
FROM recordings
WHERE user_id = 'e8403df0-339a-4879-95bb-169bca9564d8';

-- Test the view
SELECT * FROM meetings_with_recordings
WHERE user_id = 'e8403df0-339a-4879-95bb-169bca9564d8';
-- Should return: 2 rows
```
