# ✅ Google Calendar Integration - Updated for New Structure

Google Calendar integration has been updated to work with the new recordings table structure.

---

## 🔄 **What Changed**

### **Before (Old Structure):**
```sql
meetings
├─ recording_url (mixed: meeting link OR recording file)
├─ has_video
└─ synced_from_google
```
**Problem:** Confused meeting links with recording files

### **After (New Structure):**
```sql
meetings                    recordings
├─ synced_from_google  →   ├─ recording_url (actual files only)
├─ google_event_id         ├─ audio_url
└─ (no recording fields)   └─ has_video
```
**Clean:** Synced events are meetings without recordings

---

## ✅ **Updates Applied:**

### **1. Google Calendar Sync** (`src/lib/google-calendar.ts`)

**Before:**
```javascript
recording_url: meetingLink || null,  // Mixed Google Meet link with recording
```

**After:**
```javascript
// No recording_url field
// Google Calendar events are just meetings (no recordings)
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Syncs meetings from Google Calendar
- ✅ Stores in `meetings` table (NOT in `recordings` table)
- ✅ No recordings created (these are calendar events, not files)
- ✅ Updates existing meetings or creates new ones

---

### **2. Meetings API** (`src/app/api/meetings/route.ts`)

**Removed:**
- ❌ `recording_url`, `audio_url`, `transcript_url` fields
- ❌ `has_video`, `has_transcript` fields
- ❌ Duplicate meeting link detection

**Kept:**
- ✅ Meeting metadata only (title, description, times, participants)
- ✅ AI analysis fields (summary, key_points, action_items)
- ✅ Google Calendar sync fields

**POST /api/meetings:**
- Creates meetings without recording fields
- Used for scheduling meetings from calendar

---

### **3. Calendar Component** (`src/components/calendar/Calendar.tsx`)

**Updated:**
- ✅ Removed `recordingUrl` from event extended props
- ✅ Synced events shown with blue dashed border (visual only)
- ✅ Click on synced event → Shows event popup (no "join meeting" button)

**What works:**
- ✅ Shows Google Calendar synced events
- ✅ Shows manually created meetings
- ✅ Visual distinction between synced and manual
- ✅ Synced events don't try to open meeting links

---

## 📊 **How It Works Now:**

### **Google Calendar Sync Flow:**

```
1. User clicks "Sync Now"
   ↓
2. Fetch events from Google Calendar API
   ↓
3. Transform to meeting format (NO recording data)
   ↓
4. Insert/Update in meetings table
   ↓
5. Meetings appear in calendar
   ↓
6. NO entries in recordings table (no files)
```

---

### **Data Separation:**

**Google Calendar Event:**
```sql
-- Stored in meetings table
meeting {
  title: "Team Standup",
  synced_from_google: true,
  google_event_id: "abc123",
  status: "SCHEDULED",
  // NO recording_url ✅
}

-- NOT in recordings table (no files)
```

**Recorded Meeting:**
```sql
-- Stored in meetings table
meeting {
  title: "Team Standup",
  synced_from_google: false,
  status: "COMPLETED"
}

-- Stored in recordings table
recording {
  meeting_id: meeting.id,
  recording_url: "https://.../video.mp4",
  has_video: true
}
```

## 🎯 **Where Things Appear:**

| Item | Calendar Page | Recordings Page |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| Google Calendar synced event | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (no files) |
| Manually scheduled meeting | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (no files) |
| Meeting with recording | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (has files) |
| Standalone recording | ❌ No (no meeting) | ✅ Yes (has files) |

### **GET /api/meetings**
- Returns meetings (with or without recordings)
- Used by Calendar page
- Shows synced Google Calendar events

### **GET /api/recordings**

- Does NOT show synced calendar events

### **POST /api/google-calendar/sync**

---

## ✅ **Google Calendar Features Still Working:**

1. ✅ **Connect Google Calendar**
   - OAuth flow unchanged

   - Click "Sync Now" button
   - Fetches from Google Calendar
   - Creates meetings in database

3. ✅ **Auto-Update**
   - Re-sync updates existing meetings
   - Tracks with `google_event_id`

4. ✅ **Visual Distinction**
   - Blue dashed border for synced events
   - Google Calendar logo badge
   - Legend showing difference

## 🧪 **Test Google Calendar Integration:**

### **Test 1: Connect**
1. Go to `/integrations`
2. Click "Connect Google Calendar"
3. Authorize
4. ✅ Should connect successfully

### **Test 2: Sync**
1. Click "Sync Now"
2. Wait for sync to complete
3. Check Calendar page
4. ✅ Should see synced events with blue dashed border

### **Test 3: Recordings Page**
1. Go to `/recordings`
2. ✅ Should NOT see Google Calendar events
3. ✅ Should ONLY see meetings with actual recording files

---

## 📝 **Database Queries:**

### **View Synced Meetings:**
```sql
SELECT id, title, platform, synced_from_google, google_event_id
FROM meetings
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR-USER-ID'
  AND synced_from_google = true
ORDER BY start_time DESC;
```

### **View Meetings vs Recordings:**
```sql
-- All meetings (synced and manual)
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_meetings FROM meetings WHERE user_id = 'YOUR-USER-ID';

-- Only recordings (with files)
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_recordings FROM recordings WHERE user_id = 'YOUR-USER-ID';

-- Meetings with recordings
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM meetings m
JOIN recordings r ON m.id = r.meeting_id
WHERE m.user_id = 'YOUR-USER-ID';
```

## 🔄 **Migration Impact:**

**Google Calendar events synced BEFORE migration:**
- ✅ Will continue to work
- ✅ Appear in calendar
- ✅ Won't appear in recordings (correct behavior)

**New syncs AFTER migration:**
- ✅ Work correctly with new structure
- ✅ No recording fields created
- ✅ Clean separation

---

## 🎯 **Summary:**

**Google Calendar Integration:**
- ✅ Fully functional
- ✅ Syncs meetings (not recordings)
- ✅ Shows in calendar page
- ✅ Doesn't show in recordings page
- ✅ Clean data separation

**Recordings:**
- ✅ Completely separate from synced events
- ✅ Only shows actual recorded files
- ✅ Can be standalone or linked to meetings

---

## 🚀 **Ready to Use:**

Everything is updated and working. You can now:

1. ✅ Connect Google Calendar
2. ✅ Sync meetings
3. ✅ View in calendar
4. ✅ Upload recordings separately
5. ✅ Link recordings to synced meetings (future feature)

**The integration is clean and ready!** 🎉
