## 📝 Part 1: Google Cloud Console Setup (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Google OAuth Credentials

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console:**
   - Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/

2. **Create or Select a Project:**
   - Click the project dropdown at the top
   - Click "New Project"
   - Name it: "Bluenote" (or your app name)
   - Click "Create"

3. **Enable Google+ API:**
   - In the search bar, type "Google+ API"
   - Click on "Google+ API"
   - Click "Enable"

4. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen:**
   - Go to: **APIs & Services** → **OAuth consent screen**
   - Select: **External**
   - Click "Create"
   
   **Fill in the form:**
   - App name: `Bluenote`
   - User support email: Your email
   - Developer contact: Your email
   - Click "Save and Continue"
   
   **Scopes:**
   - Click "Add or Remove Scopes"
   - Select: `email`, `profile`, `openid`
   - Click "Update"
   - Click "Save and Continue"
   
   **Test Users (for development):**
   - Click "Add Users"
   - Add your Gmail address
   - Click "Save and Continue"

5. **Create OAuth Client ID:**
   - Go to: **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
   - Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth client ID"
   - Application type: **Web application**
   - Name: `Bluenote Web Client`
   
   **Authorized JavaScript origins:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   https://bxdegqsladfaczeixnmh.supabase.co
   ```
   
   **Authorized redirect URIs:**
   ```
   https://bxdegqsladfaczeixnmh.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   ```
   
   - Click "Create"
   
6. **Copy Your Credentials:**
   - You'll see a popup with:
     - **Client ID** (looks like: `123456789-abc.apps.googleusercontent.com`)
     - **Client Secret** (looks like: `GOCSPX-abc123...`)
   - **SAVE THESE!** You'll need them for Supabase

## 🔧 Part 2: Supabase Configuration (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Enable Google Provider

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project

2. **Enable Google Auth:**
   - Go to: **Authentication** → **Providers**
   - Find "Google" in the list
   - Toggle it **ON**

3. **Add Your Google Credentials:**
   - **Client ID:** Paste the Client ID from Google Console
   - **Client Secret:** Paste the Client Secret from Google Console
   - Click "Save"

### Step 2: Get Your Supabase Redirect URL

The redirect URL is:
```
https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
```

Example:
```
https://bxdegqsladfaczeixnmh.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
```

**This should already be in Google Console from Step 1!**

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Access blocked: This app's request is invalid"

**Solution:**
- Make sure OAuth consent screen is configured
- Add yourself as a test user
- Enable Google+ API

### Issue 2: "Redirect URI mismatch"

**Solution:**
- Check the redirect URI in Google Console matches exactly:
  ```
  https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
  ```
- No trailing slashes
- Must be https (not http)

### Issue 3: "This app isn't verified"

**For Development:**
- Click "Advanced" → "Go to Bluenote (unsafe)"
- This is normal for development apps
- To remove this, you need to verify your app with Google (takes time)

**For Production:**
- Submit your app for verification in Google Cloud Console
- Or keep it in "Testing" mode (limited to test users)

### Issue 4: "Invalid client"

**Solution:**
- Double-check Client ID and Client Secret in Supabase
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Regenerate credentials if needed

## 🌐 Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

### 1. Update Google Cloud Console:

**Authorized JavaScript origins:**
```
https://yourdomain.com
https://bxdegqsladfaczeixnmh.supabase.co
```

**Authorized redirect URIs:**
```
https://bxdegqsladfaczeixnmh.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### 3. Publish OAuth Consent Screen:

- Go to OAuth consent screen
- Click "Publish App"
- Or keep in "Testing" mode with specific users

---

## 📱 Additional Providers (Optional)

You can also add:
- Microsoft/Azure AD
- GitHub
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Apple

Same process - enable in Supabase and configure OAuth app!

## 🎯 Next Steps

After I update your code:

1. Complete Google Cloud setup above
2. Enable Google in Supabase
3. Test the Google sign-in button
4. You're done! 🎉

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Development Mode:** Keep your app in "Testing" mode in Google Console. Only add specific test users.

2. **Profile Pictures:** Save the Google profile picture URL to your database for avatars.

3. **Email is Verified:** Users who sign in with Google don't need email verification - Google already verified them!

4. **One Account, Multiple Providers:** If a user signs up with email then later uses Google with the same email, Supabase links them automatically.
