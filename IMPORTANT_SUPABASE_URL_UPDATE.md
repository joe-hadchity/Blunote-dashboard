# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Update Supabase Redirect URL

## üîß You Must Update This in Supabase Dashboard

### Go to Supabase Dashboard:

1. Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to: **Authentication** ‚Üí **URL Configuration**
4. Under **Redirect URLs**, find:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
   ```
5. **Change it to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/callback
   ```
6. Click **Save**

### Important:
- The URL changed from `/auth/callback` to `/callback`
- This is because of Next.js route groups
- Must update in Supabase for verification to work

### For Production:
When you deploy, also add:
```
https://yourdomain.com/callback
```
