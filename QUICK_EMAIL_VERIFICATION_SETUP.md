## 🚨 Common Issues

### "Not receiving emails?"
- Check spam folder
- Make sure email confirmation is **enabled** in Supabase
- Use a real email address (not temporary)

### "Invalid verification link?"
- Links expire after 24 hours
- Click the "Resend verification email" button
- Use the newest email

### "Still can login without verification?"
- Make sure "Confirm email" is **ON** in Supabase
- Clear browser cookies
- Log out and try again

## 📧 Production Setup (Later)

Before deploying to production:

1. Update `.env.local`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   ```

2. Add production redirect URL in Supabase:
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/callback
   ```

3. (Optional) Set up custom SMTP for better email delivery:
   - SendGrid, Mailgun, or Resend
   - Configure in: Supabase → Project Settings → Auth → SMTP Settings
