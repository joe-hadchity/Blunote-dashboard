# Recording Widget Setup & Testing Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The recording widget in your sidebar now **actually works** and can stop recordings from the Bluenote web app!

### Changes Made:

1. **Created Functional SidebarWidget** (`src/layout/SidebarWidget.tsx`)
   - Shows live recording status
   - Displays recording duration
   - Has a working "Stop Recording" button

2. **Added Communication Bridge** (`extension/content/app-bridge.js`)
   - Bridges messages between extension and web app
   - Forwards recording status to React app
   - Handles stop recording requests

3. **Updated Extension Service Worker** (`extension/background/service-worker.js`)
   - Broadcasts recording status to web app tabs every second
   - Listens for stop requests from web app
   - Properly stops recording when requested

4. **Updated Extension Manifest** (`extension/manifest.json`)
   - Added content script for localhost:3000
   - Enables communication with web app

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Reload the Extension

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Bluenote" extension
3. Click the **reload** icon ⟳
4. Make sure it's enabled

### Step 2: Open Bluenote Web App

1. Make sure your Next.js app is running:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open `http://localhost:3000` in Chrome
3. Log in if needed
4. The sidebar should be visible (expand it if collapsed)

### Step 3: Start a Test Recording

#### Option A: Join a Real Meeting
1. Go to Google Meet, Zoom, or Teams
2. Join any meeting
3. Click Bluenote extension icon
4. Click "🔴 Start Recording"

#### Option B: Create a Test Meeting (Google Meet)
1. Go to https://meet.google.com/
2. Click "New meeting" → "Start an instant meeting"
3. Click Bluenote extension icon
4. Click "🔴 Start Recording"

### Step 4: Watch the Widget Appear

Once recording starts, you should see:

**In the meeting page:**
- Red floating widget in top-right corner
- Shows recording time (e.g., "0:15")

**In the Bluenote web app sidebar:**
- Red recording widget appears
- Shows live timer
- Shows "Stop Recording" button

### Step 5: Stop Recording from Web App

1. Go to your Bluenote web app tab (`localhost:3000`)
2. Look at the sidebar (expand if collapsed)
3. You should see the recording widget with live timer
4. Click **"Stop Recording"** button

**Expected Result:**
- Recording stops immediately
- Widget disappears from sidebar
- Widget disappears from meeting page
- Badge timer stops on extension icon
- Recording gets uploaded to your dashboard

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Widget Doesn't Appear

**Problem:** Recording started but widget doesn't show in web app

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure extension is reloaded
2. Refresh the web app page (`localhost:3000`)
3. Check browser console for errors:
   - Press F12
   - Look for "Bluenote app bridge" message
   - Should see "RECORDING_STATUS" messages

### Stop Button Doesn't Work

**Problem:** Clicking stop does nothing

**Solutions:**
1. Check console for errors
2. Make sure content script is loaded:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console on localhost:3000
   console.log('Testing bridge');
   window.postMessage({ type: 'STOP_RECORDING_REQUEST' }, '*');
   ```
3. Reload extension and refresh page

### Widget Shows Wrong Time

**Problem:** Timer doesn't match extension badge

**Solutions:**
- Refresh the web app page
- This syncs with extension on next broadcast (1 second)

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Widget Only Shows When Recording

The widget automatically:
- **Appears** when recording starts
- **Updates** every second with new duration
- **Disappears** when recording stops

### Multiple Tabs Support

If you have multiple Bluenote web app tabs open:
- All tabs receive recording status
- All tabs show the widget
- Stop button works from any tab

### Security

- Messages only accepted from same origin
- Extension ID validation (when configured)
- No cross-origin message acceptance

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Widget Color

Edit `src/layout/SidebarWidget.tsx`:

```tsx
// Line 67 - Change background gradient
className="... from-red-500 to-red-600 ..."

// Change to blue:
className="... from-blue-500 to-blue-600 ..."
```

### Change Widget Position

Currently in sidebar. To move elsewhere, import component in different layout file.

### Hide When Sidebar Collapsed

Already implemented! Widget only shows when sidebar is expanded.

## ✨ Next Steps

Now that stop recording works, you can:

1. **Add more controls:**
   - Pause/Resume recording
   - Show recording file size
   - Preview audio waveform

2. **Add notifications:**
   - Toast when recording starts/stops
   - Upload progress indicator

3. **Improve UX:**
   - Smooth animations
   - Sound effects on start/stop
   - Confirmation dialog before stopping

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Extension ID Placeholder:**
   - `YOUR_EXTENSION_ID_HERE` in SidebarWidget.tsx
   - Not critical for localhost testing
   - Update for production deployment

2. **Localhost Only:**
   - Content script only runs on `localhost:3000`
   - Update manifest for production domain

3. **Single Recording:**
   - Widget shows first active recording only
   - Fine for most use cases
