## üéØ Expected Results

After successful upload, you should have:

‚úÖ **Files in Storage:**
```
meeting-videos/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {your-user-id}/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {timestamp}-your-video.mp4

meeting-audios/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {your-user-id}/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {timestamp}-your-audio.mp3
```

‚úÖ **Meeting in Database:**
```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "title": "My Test Meeting",
  "recording_url": "https://xxx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/meeting-videos/...",
  "audio_url": "https://xxx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/meeting-audios/...",
  "has_video": true,
  "has_transcript": false
}
```

‚úÖ **Accessible URLs:**
- Video URL should be publicly accessible
- Audio URL should be publicly accessible

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Storage bucket not found"
**Solution:** Run the storage setup SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor

### Issue: "Permission denied" when uploading
**Solution:** 
- Check that buckets are set to "Public"
- Verify storage policies are created
- Make sure you're logged in

### Issue: "File too large"
**Solution:**
- Videos: Max 500MB (adjust in `src/lib/storage.ts` if needed)
- Audio: Max 100MB
- Compress files if needed

### Issue: "Invalid file type"
**Solution:**
- Check allowed MIME types in `validateFile()` function
- Videos: video/*
- Audio: audio/*

### Issue: Upload succeeds but meeting creation fails
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `/api/meetings` endpoint is working
- Check that you're authenticated

## üìä File Size Limits

| File Type | Max Size | Bucket |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Video | 500 MB | meeting-videos |
| Audio | 100 MB | meeting-audios |
| Transcript | 10 MB | meeting-transcripts |

To change these limits, edit `src/lib/storage.ts` in the `validateFile()` function.

## üîê Security Notes

**Current Setup (For Testing):**
- ‚úÖ Buckets are public
- ‚úÖ Anyone with URL can view files
- ‚úÖ Only authenticated users can upload

**For Production:**
- Consider making buckets private
- Use signed URLs for temporary access
- Add row-level security
- Implement file scanning for malware
