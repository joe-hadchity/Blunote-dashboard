# 🎙️ Audio Visualization Added!

## ✅ What's New

I've added **real-time audio level visualization** to show you that audio is being captured!

---

## 🎨 Visual Feedback

### During Recording, You'll See:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  ⏺️ Recording              │
│     00:45                  │
│                            │
│  [█][█][█][█][][][][]      │
│  Audio level: 45%          │
│  (Bars bounce with audio!) │
│                            │
│  [Stop Recording]          │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Color Coding:
- **Blue bars** = Low level (0-40%)
- **Orange bars** = Medium level (40-70%)
- **Red bars** = High level (70-100%)

### What It Shows:
- ✅ If bars are moving = Audio is being captured! ✅
- ❌ If bars don't move = No audio detected! ❌

---

## 🧪 Test It

### Step 1: Reload Extension
```
chrome://extensions → Bluenote → Reload
```

### Step 2: Start Recording
```
1. Go to YouTube (play a video with audio)
2. Click Bluenote
3. Click "Start Recording"
```

### Step 3: Watch the Bars!

**If bars are bouncing:**
- ✅ Audio IS being captured!
- ✅ Recording should work!
- ✅ File should NOT be empty!

**If bars DON'T move:**
- ❌ No audio detected
- ❌ Tab might be muted
- ❌ Video might not be playing
- ❌ Permission issue

## 🎯 This Helps Us Debug

The visualization shows REAL-TIME if audio is flowing:

1. **Bars moving** = getUserMedia is working
2. **Level changing** = Audio is being processed
3. **No movement** = Problem with audio capture

---

## 📊 How It Works

```
Tab Audio
   ↓
getUserMedia (captures audio)
   ↓
AudioContext Analyser
   ↓
Calculate audio level (0-100%)
   ↓
Send to popup every 100ms
   ↓
Update 8 bars to visualize level
```

## ✅ What to Look For

### Good Signs:
- Bars move up/down with audio
- Level shows 20-80% when speaking/playing
- Level shows 0-10% when silent
- Bars change color (blue → orange → red)

### Bad Signs:
- All bars stay flat (gray)
- Level always shows 0%
- Text says "Audio level: --"
- No response to audio playing
