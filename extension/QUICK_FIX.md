# ✅ QUICK FIX - Recording Issue Resolved

## What Was Fixed

The extension now uses the **Manifest V3 compliant approach** for audio capture:

1. **Popup** calls `chrome.tabCapture.getMediaStreamId()` (✅ Works in popup context)
2. **Background** creates an **offscreen document** (✅ Can use getUserMedia)
3. **Offscreen document** captures audio using the stream ID
4. **Audio recorded** and sent back to background
5. **Background uploads** to your backend

```
1. Go to: chrome://extensions/
2. Find "Bluenote - Meeting Recorder"
3. Click the 🔄 RELOAD button

## 🎯 **Key Changes Summary**

| Old Approach | New Approach |
|-------------|-------------|
| Background tries to use `tabCapture.capture` | ❌ Not allowed in service workers |
| Popup calls `getMediaStreamId` | ✅ Allowed with user gesture |
| Offscreen document uses `getUserMedia` | ✅ Allowed in documents |
| Audio flows: Tab → Offscreen → Background → Backend | ✅ Manifest V3 compliant |

## 🚀 **Next Step: Noise Cancellation**

Once recording works, we'll add:
- Real-time noise cancellation using RNNoise
- Audio processing in offscreen document
- Cleaner audio before upload

But first, let's make sure basic recording works! 🎉
