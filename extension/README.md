## 🔊 How Noise Cancellation Works

### Current Implementation:

1. **Tab Audio Capture** → Raw audio stream from meeting
2. **Web Audio API** → Process audio in real-time
3. **Noise Suppression** → Browser's built-in noise cancellation
4. **MediaRecorder** → Save cleaned audio
5. **Upload** → Send to Bluenote backend

### Future Enhancement (Advanced):

- **RNNoise.js** integration for better quality
- **Adjustable noise reduction** levels
- **Echo cancellation**
- **Voice enhancement**

  platform: String  
  duration: Number
  meetingUrl: String
```

### Data Flow:

```
Extension Records Audio
  ↓
Uploads to /api/extension/upload-recording
  ↓
Saves to Supabase Storage
  ↓
Creates recording in database
