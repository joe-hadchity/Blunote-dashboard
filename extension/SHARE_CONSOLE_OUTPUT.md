## 💡 Quick Questions

Before sharing console output, answer these:

1. **Is your microphone unmuted in Google Meet?** (Check the mic icon)
2. **Did Chrome ask for microphone permission?** (Popup asking to allow mic)
3. **Did you click "Allow"?** (Not "Block")
4. **Is audio actually playing in the tab?** (Can you hear other people?)
5. **Are you talking loudly into your mic?** (Test by saying "hello" loudly)

**Chrome didn't ask for mic permission OR you clicked "Block"**

### How to Fix:

1. Click the camera/mic icon 🎥 in Chrome's address bar (on Meet page)
2. Set Microphone to "Allow"
3. Reload the Meet page
4. Try recording again
